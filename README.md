Supported versions:

- `GGTE01`: USA rev 0
- `GGTJ01_01`: Japan rev 1
- `GGTP01`: Europe rev 0

This repository contains no game assets. You need your own copy of the game to build it.

## Dependencies

### Windows

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add it to PATH, then install ninja with `py -m pip install ninja`. Use `py` instead of `python3` below.

### macOS

```sh
brew install python ninja
```

### Linux

Install Python 3.10 or later and ninja with your package manager.

The build downloads its compiler and other tools on first run.

## Building

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CleoSp/chibirobo-decomp.git
cd chibirobo-decomp
```

Put an ISO, RVZ or CISO of your game in the folder for its version: `orig/GGTE01/`, `orig/GGTJ01_01/` or `orig/GGTP01/`.

Configure and build:

```sh
python3 configure.py
ninja
```

To pick a version, add `--version GGTE01`, `--version GGTJ01_01` or `--version GGTP01` to the configure command.

The build checks the DOL and 16 RELs against the originals. Unfinished units still link original code.

## Progress site

The Progress workflow rebuilds all three versions on the self-hosted runner,
then publishes the interactive page and README badges to
[cleosp.com/chibirobo-decomp](https://cleosp.com/chibirobo-decomp/). It runs when
source, config, or tools change on the default branch, and can also be run from
the Actions tab. Failed builds leave the last published page in place.

The runner needs `CHIBIROBO_ORIG` set to its local `orig/` folder. Only the
progress report goes to GitHub; the discs stay on the runner. In the repo’s
Pages settings, the publishing source should be **GitHub Actions**.

## Diffing

Once the first build succeeds, open [objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff/releases), set its project directory to your clone and select a unit. objdiff reads the generated `objdiff.json` and rebuilds automatically when source, header or config files change.

Before opening a pull request, compile all source:

```sh
ninja all_source progress
```

Include your source and config changes in the pull request. Keep game files and build output out of it.

## Modding

Configure with `--non-matching` to build modified or non-matching code:

```sh
python3 configure.py --non-matching
ninja
```

The output DOL is written to `build/GGTE01/main.dol`, or to the folder for the version you built.
